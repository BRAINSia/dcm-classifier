# Introduction

In this work, we developed a robust, easily extensible classification framework that extracts key features from well-characterized DICOM header fields to identify image modality and acquisition plane. 
Utilizing classical machine learning paradigms and a heterogeneous dataset of 9121 scans collected at 12 sites, using 23 scanners from 6 manufacturers, we achieved 99.4% accuracy during the K-Fold Cross-Validation for classifying 11 image modalities and 99.96% accuracy on image acquisition plane classification. Furthermore, we demonstrated model generalizability by achieving 98.6% accuracy on out-of-sample animal data. Our proposed framework can be crucial in eliminating error-prone human interaction, allowing automatization, and increasing imaging applications' reliability and efficiency.
