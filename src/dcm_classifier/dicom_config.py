"""
List of DICOM header columns that are required for this tool. In the future, the list can be expanded
or modified as needed.

Those fields were selected experimentally and were deemed useful for the modality and acquisition plane
classification task, or needed for data organization. Requiring only those fields allows for some flexibility in the
DICOM header and reduces the dimensionality of the data, thus improving processing efficiency.

Attributes:
    required_DICOM_fields (tuple): A tuple containing the names of
    DICOM header columns to be dropped from the dataset.

Example:
    Example usage to drop these columns from a DataFrame:
    df.drop(columns=required_DICOM_fields, inplace=True)
